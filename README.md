### What I learned

There was not much that I struggled with in this challenge. I was able to apply the knowledge I had gained from last challenge and easily complete this one within a reasonable time frame. 

### Continued development

I would like to be able to more effectively use proper HTML semantics so that my work can properly be translated into a team or collaborative setting. 

### Useful resources

- [Video Resource](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=k_37wGK1nX8Mj4BM) - This is how I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I hope I can continue to expand on this knowledge as I work through more challenges and eventually develop my own designs.
